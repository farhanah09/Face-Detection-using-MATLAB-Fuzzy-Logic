# Face-Detection-using-MATLAB-Fuzzy-Logic
Facial recognition has risen with the pandemic, along with computer vision and machine learning. This paper presents a neuro-fuzzy model in two steps: pre-processing detects facial landmarks and stores them, while the neuro-fuzzy system utilizes stored features to recognize faces. It demonstrates the model's superiority in face recognition compared
